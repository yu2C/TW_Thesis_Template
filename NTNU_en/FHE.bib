	abstract = {The advancement of biometric technology has facilitated wide applications of biometrics in law enforcement, border control, healthcare and financial identification and verification. Given the peculiarity of biometric features (e.g., unchangeability, permanence and uniqueness), the security of biometric data is a key area of research. Security and privacy are vital to enacting integrity, reliability and availability in biometric-related applications. Homomorphic encryption ({HE}) is concerned with data manipulation in the cryptographic domain, thus addressing the security and privacy issues faced by biometrics. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art {HE} research in the context of biometrics. Detailed analyses and discussions are conducted on various {HE} approaches to biometric security according to the categories of different biometric traits. Moreover, this review presents the perspective of integrating {HE} with other emerging technologies (e.g., machine/deep learning and blockchain) for biometric security. Finally, based on the latest development of {HE} in biometrics, challenges and future research directions are put forward.},

	abstract = {We present two new statistical machine learning methods designed to learn on fully homomorphic encrypted ({FHE}) data. The introduction of {FHE} schemes following Gentry (2009) opens up the prospect of privacy preserving statistical machine learning analysis and modelling of encrypted data without compromising security constraints. We propose tailored algorithms for applying extremely random forests, involving a new cryptographic stochastic fraction estimator, and na¨ıve Bayes, involving a semi-parametric model for the class decision boundary, and show how they can be used to learn and predict from encrypted data. We demonstrate that these techniques perform competitively on a variety of classiﬁcation data sets and provide detailed information about the computational practicalities of these and other {FHE} methods.},

predictive chemistry and reaction informatics driven by machine learning
applications to computer-aided synthesis planning. While many of these
developments have been made even with relatively small, bespoke data

must be significant improvements in the reporting of reaction data.
Currently, the majority of publicly available data is reported in
an unstructured format and heavily imbalanced toward high-yielding
reactions, which influences the types of models that can be successfully
trained. In this Perspective, we analyze several data curation and
sharing initiatives that have seen success in chemistry and molecular
biology. We discuss several factors that have contributed to their
success and how we can take lessons from these case studies and apply
them to reaction data. Finally, we spotlight the Open Reaction Database
and summarize key actions the community can take toward making reaction
data more findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable ({FAIR}),
including the use of mandates from funding agencies and publishers.},

	abstract = {We present new results on the underlying guest–host interactions and spectral characterization of a {CO}2 molecule confined in the cages of the {sI} clathrate hydrate. Such types of porous solids raise computational challenges, as they are of practical interest as gas storage/capture materials. Accordingly, we have directed our efforts toward addressing their modeling in a proper manner, ensuring the quality of the input data and the efficiency of the computational approaches. The computational procedure for spectral simulations, within the multi-configurational time-dependent Hartree framework, involves the development of a fully coupled Hamiltonian, including an exact kinetic energy operator and a many-body representation of the potential, along with dipole moment surfaces, both obtained through neural network machine learning techniques. The resulting models were automatically trained and tested on extensive datasets generated by {PW}86PBE-{XDM} calculations, following the outcome of previous benchmark studies. Our simulations enable us to explore various aspects of the quantized dynamics upon confinement of {CO}2@D/T, such as constrained rotational–translational quantum motions and the averaged position/orientation of the {CO}2 guest in comparison to the experimental data available. Particularly notable are the distinct energy patterns observed in the computed spectra for the confined {CO}2 in the D and T cages, with a considerably high rotational–translational coupling in the {CO}2@T case. Leveraging reliable computations has proved instrumental, highlighting the sensitivity of the spectral features to the shape and strength of the potential interactions, with the explicit description of many-body contributions being significant.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen increased interest in research on biometric template protection due to the widespread use of biometric authentication systems. For providing security to biometric templates, there is a procedure known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption that protects biometric templates from the malicious server environment. Users have more customization options with a biometric authentication system than a password or token. The most popular biometric modalities include fingerprints, iris scans, facial images, etc. Biometric modalities offer security on {IoMT} -based systems. Face recognition is one of the most often utilized biometric authentication methods in societal structure. Face recognition technology has made enormous strides in recent years. Here, we examine the viability of securing a database of iris templates using a methodology based on fully homomorphic Encryption. By directly matching templates in the encrypted domain, this framework is designed to protect confidentiality and restrict information from leaking from the templates while preserving their utility. We also investigate various classification techniques on machine learning models to achieve improved accuracy with shorter execution times. The aggregate verification vector assists in confirming the accuracy of the computed classification result, and the {CKKS} technique ensures confidentiality for the biometric templates. This study provides a plethora of information on fully homomorphic biometric authentication, containing a wide assortment of algorithms that satisfy homomorphic Encryption and various methods for extracting the biometric-related template.},

	title = {Allora: a Self-Improving, Decentralized Machine Intelligence Network},
	abstract = {Recent advances in data access and computing power have enabled the first forms of machine intelligence capable of offering meaningful insights. However, the tremendous resources required have caused these solutions to be closed and siloed by industry monoliths. To achieve the full potential of machine intelligence, the data, algorithms, and participants must be maximally connected. Network solutions are needed, and the decentralized nature of blockchain technology is ideal for solving this problem. We introduce Allora, a self-improving, decentralized machine intelligence network that surpasses the capabilities of its individual participants by design. Allora achieves this through two main innovations. First, it lets network participants forecast each other’s performance under the current conditions, thereby creating a form of context-awareness that enables the network to achieve the best inferences under any circumstances. Second, it introduces a differentiated incentive structure that rewards network participants for their unique contribution to the network goal, tailored to their specific task and purpose, avoiding any distracting incentives. We show that these innovations make Allora’s inferences considerably more accurate than before. With its versatility and accessibility, Allora paves the way for machine intelligence to become fully commoditized and integrated with the economy, technology, and society.},
